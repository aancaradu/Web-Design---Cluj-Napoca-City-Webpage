The first webpage, which is the main page, consists of index.html, index-style.css and index.js. Here we have a carousel of photos of Cluj-Napoca, a 'Learn More button taking us to the city's Wikipedia page and a 'Contact' button, that takes us to the contact.html or 'Contact' webpage I created. Below, we can go to ClujBike's site using the 'REGISTER AND RENT' button and under that, a gallery of my personal photos of the city. To visualize the pcitures, they must be clicked. 
The next page is the 'Events' one, or events.html, with the stylesheet events.css, providing buttons to each event's site. 
Third comes in place the 'History' one, or history.html, having the stylesheet 'history.css', which has link images down below, with a path to each museum's site.
