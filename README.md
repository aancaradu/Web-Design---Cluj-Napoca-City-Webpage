The first webpage, which is the main page, consists of index.html, index-style.css and index.js. Here we have a carousel of photos of Cluj-Napoca, a 'Learn More' button taking us to the city's Wikipedia page and a 'Contact' button, that takes us to the contact.html or 'Contact' webpage I created. Below, we can go to ClujBike's site using the 'REGISTER AND RENT' button and under that, a gallery of my personal photos of the city. To visualize the pcitures, they must be clicked. <br><br>
The next page is the 'Events' one, or events.html, with the stylesheet events.css, providing buttons to each event's site. <br><br>
Third comes in place the 'History' one, or history.html, having the stylesheet 'history.css', which has link images down below, with a path to each museum's site.<br><br>
The fourth page, 'Sightseeing' - sightseeing.html, with the stylesheet sightseeing.css, providing anchor image polaroids, each polaroid leading to a documantation about the touristic attractions.<br><br>
The 'Services' page, services.html with stylesheet services.css is a presentation of restaurants, each anchor image taking us to the menu of said restaurant.<br><br>
Lastly, the 'Education' page, education.html with the stylesheet education.css, talks a little about the mainn universities in Romania, providing anchor image polaroids taking us to the universities' sites.<br><br><br>
