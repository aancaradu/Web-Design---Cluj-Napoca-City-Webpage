        <p class="item1"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
        <p class="item2">Cluj-Napoca, city, capital of Cluj county, northwestern Romania. The historic capital of Transylvania, 
        it is approximately 200 mi (320 km) northwest of Bucharest in the Someșul Mic River valley. 
        The city stands on the site of an ancient Dacian settlement, Napoca, which the Romans made a municipium.
          <br><br>
        In the Middle Ages the name of the city was Culus, as attested in documents of 1173, but by the beginning 
        of the 15th century it was known as Cluj (probably from Castrum Clus, a small fortification dating from 1213).
         The city has also been known by its German name, Klausenburg, and its Hungarian name, Kolozsvár. It 
         became a thriving commercial and cultural centre, and in 1405 it was declared a free town. 
         After the constitution of the autonomous principality of Transylvania in the 16th century, 
         Cluj became its capital. In 1920 the city, with the rest of Transylvania, was incorporated into Romania.
          Napoca was added to the city's name in 1974.
          <br><br>
        Among the historic monuments are the house in which Matthias I Corvinus (king of Hungary, 1458-90) was born; 
        the Roman Catholic cathedral of St. Michael (1321-1444), one of the largest Gothic churches in Romania; 
        and the Bánffy Palace (1773-85), now a fine arts museum. The city is the location of the Babeș-Bolyai
         University, 
        several technical and professional institutes, the Ion Andreescu Institute of Fine Arts, the Gheorghe Dima 
        Conservatory, and a branch of the Academy of Romania. The institute of speleology was the first of its kind
         in the world. 
        The botanical gardens are considered to be the richest in Romania.</p>

        <p class="item1-2nd"><strong>Transylvania</strong></p>
        <p class="item2">Cluj-Napoca's historical significance is deeply intertwined with the region of Transylvania, 
        which has long been a crossroads of cultures, political shifts, and legends. As a central hub in Transylvania, 
        Cluj-Napoca has been instrumental in shaping the region's identity, especially during key historical periods.
        <br><br>
        Transylvania's complex history, marked by its ancient Dacian roots, Roman influence, and later Hungarian and 
        Ottoman control, finds much of its narrative reflected in Cluj-Napoca. Throughout the Middle Ages, the city 
        served as a vital political and cultural center within the Kingdom of Hungary, and later the autonomous 
        Principality of Transylvania. It was during this time that Transylvania became closely associated with some 
        of the most enduring figures in European history, including Vlad III, known as Vlad the Impaler, or "Dracula." 
        While Vlad the Impaler's reign was marked by his brutal methods of ruling, his connection to Transylvania, and 
        particularly to the region around Cluj-Napoca, is critical. His fortress, the famous Poenari Castle, lies not 
        far from the city, and his legacy, intertwined with the myth of Dracula, continues to shape perceptions of 
        Transylvania as a land of mystery and darkness.
        <br><br>
        The 16th century was another pivotal period for both Cluj-Napoca and Transylvania, as the region became a 
        battleground for religious movements, with the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation 
        taking root. Cluj-Napoca, home to influential universities and intellectual hubs, played a significant role 
        in these religious and cultural transformations. The city, and Transylvania as a whole, became a beacon of 
        religious tolerance, where multiple faiths coexisted and thrived, a rare feature in a Europe torn by religious 
        wars.
        <br><br>
        In the 20th century, Transylvania became part of Romania following World War I, but Cluj-Napoca remained a 
        central figure in the region, symbolizing both the tumultuous past and the enduring cultural identity of 
        Transylvania. The legacy of figures like Vlad the Impaler, whose legend was immortalized by Bram Stoker's 
        "Dracula," continues to draw attention to Transylvania's rich and mysterious history, with Cluj-Napoca at 
        the heart of this tale. The city's connection to Transylvania is not merely a matter of geography but of 
        legend, politics, and culture, making it a lasting symbol of the region's diverse and storied past.</p>

        <p class="item1"><strong>Romania</strong></p>
        <p class="item2">Romania is a country located in the southeastern Europe, its national capital being Bucharest. 
        Romania was occupied by Soviet troops in 1944 and became a satellite of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
        Republics (U.S.S.R.) in 1948. The country was under communist rule from 1948 until 1989, when the regime 
        of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceaușescu was overthrown. Free elections were held in 1990. In 2004 the country 
        joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and in 2007 it became a member of the European Union 
        (EU).
        <br><br>
        The Romanian landscape is approximately one-third mountainous and one-third forested, 
        with the remainder made up of hills and plains. The climate is temperate and marked by four distinct 
        seasons. Romania enjoys a considerable wealth of natural resources: fertile land for agriculture; 
        pastures for livestock; forests that provide hard and soft woods; petroleum reserves; metals, 
        including gold and silver in the Apuseni Mountains; numerous rivers that supply hydroelectricity; and 
        a Black Sea coastline that is the site of both ports and resorts.
        <br><br>
        The Romanian people derive much of their ethnic and cultural character from Roman influence, 
        but this ancient identity has been reshaped continuously by Romania's position astride major continental 
        migration routes. Romanians regard themselves as the descendants of the ancient Romans who conquered 
        southern Transylvania under the emperor Trajan in 105 ce and of the Dacians who lived in the mountains 
        north of the Danubian Plain and in the Transylvanian Basin. By the time of the Roman withdrawal under 
        the emperor Aurelian in 271, the Roman settlers and the Dacians had intermarried, resulting in a new nation. Both the Latin roots of the Romanian language and the Eastern Orthodox faith to which most Romanians adhere emerged from the mixture of these two cultures.
        <br><br>
        From the arrival of the Huns in the 5th century until the emergence of the principalities of Walachia and 
        Moldavia in the 14th century, the Romanian people virtually disappeared from written history. During this 
        time Romania was invaded by great folk migrations and warriors on horseback who traveled across the Danubian 
        Plain. It is believed that in the face of ceaseless violence the Romanians were forced to relocate, finding 
        safety in the Carpathian Mountains. As military chief Helmuth von Moltke observed: “Resistance having nearly 
        always proven useless, the Romanians could no longer think of any other way of defense than flight.”
        <br><br>
        For the next 600 years the Romanian lands served as battlegrounds for their neighbours' conflicting ambitions. 
        The Romanians were unable to withstand the imperial pressures first from the Byzantines and then from the 
        Ottoman Turks to the south in Constantinople (now Istanbul), or later from the Habsburg empire to the west 
        and from Russia to the east.
        <br><br>
        In 1859 the principalities of Walachia and Moldavia were united, and in 1877 they proclaimed their 
        independence from the Ottoman Empire as the modern Romania. This was accompanied by a conversion from the 
        Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin and by an exodus of students who sought higher education in western Europe, 
        especially France.
        <br><br>
        Despite its late start as a European nation-state, Romania in the 20th century produced several 
        world-renowned intellectuals, including composer Georges Enesco, playwright Eugène Ionesco, 
        philosopher Emil Cioran, religion historian Mircea Eliade, and Nobel laureate George E. Palade. 
        On the eve of World War II, journalist Rosa Goldschmidt Waldeck (Countess Waldeck) described her 
        strongest impression of the Romanians:
        <br>
        Romania is bounded by Ukraine to the north, Moldova to the northeast, the Black Sea to the southeast, 
        Bulgaria to the south, Serbia to the southwest, and Hungary to the west. There is a certain symmetry 
        in the physical structure of Romania. The country forms a complex geographic unit centred on the 
        Transylvanian Basin, around which the peaks of the Carpathian Mountains and their associated subranges 
        and structural platforms form a series of crescents. Beyond this zone, the extensive plains of the south 
        and east of the country, their potential increased by the Danube River and its tributaries, form a fertile 
        outer crescent extending to the frontiers. There is great diversity in the topography, geology, climate, 
        hydrology, flora, and fauna, and for millennia this natural environment has borne the imprint of a human 
        population.
        <br><br>
        Romania comprises a number of geographic regions, some of which correspond roughly to the historic regions 
        whose names they share. In the southern part of the country, following the general contours of the former 
        principality of the same name, Walachia (Wallachia) stretches south from the Southern Carpathians 
        (Transylvanian Alps) to the Bulgarian border and is divided by the Olt River. In the southeast, situated 
        between the lower Danube and the Black Sea, is the historic and geographic region of Dobruja, which also 
        encompasses part of Bulgaria. 
        <br><br>
        The geographic region of Moldavia, comprising only part of the former 
        principality of Moldavia (the remainder of which constitutes the country of Moldova), stretches from the 
        Eastern Carpathian Mountains to the Prut River on the Ukrainian border. In western Romania, the historic 
        Banat region is bounded on the north by the Mureș River and reaches west and south into Hungary and Serbia. 
        Finally, bounded on the north and east by the Eastern Carpathians, on the south by the Southern Carpathians, 
        and on the west by the Bihor Mountains is the geographic region of Transylvania, which is roughly contiguous 
        with the borders of the former principality of 
        Transylvania and in most schemes includes the Banat.</p>
